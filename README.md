## "Genetic interactions in Systemic Sclerosis"

This code is a reproducible workflow that accompanies the paper 
``Genetic interactions affect lung function in patients with systemic sclerosis."

This purpose of this project was to investigate genetic interactions influencing the 
presence of autoantibodies as well as lung function in a cohort of patients with systemic 
sclerosis (SSc). We use the Combines Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis (CAPE). 
which increases power to detect interactions by combining information across multiple traits.
This workflow is a companion to [cite paper] and performs each step used in the analysis.

## Abstract

Scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis (SSc), is an autoimmune disease characterized by
progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The most common cause of death 
in people with SSc is lung disease, but the pathogenesis of lung disease in SSc is
insufficiently understood to devise specific treatment strategies. Developing targeted
treatments requires not only the identification of molecular processes involved in
SSc-associated lung disease, but also understanding of how these processes interact to
drive pathology. One potentially powerful approach is to identify alleles that interact
genetically to influence lung outcomes in patients with SSc. Analysis of interactions,
rather than individual allele effects, has the potential to delineate molecular
interactions that are important in SSc-related lung pathology. However, detecting 
genetic interactions, or epistasis, in human cohorts is challenging. Large numbers of
variants with low minor allele frequencies, paired with heterogeneous disease
presentation, reduce power to detect epistasis. Here we present an analysis that
increases power to detect epistasis in human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We
tested for genetic interactions influencing lung function and autoantibody status in a
cohort of 416 SSc patients. Using Matrix Epistasis to filter SNPs followed by the
Combined Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis (CAPE), we identified a network of
interacting alleles influencing lung function in patients with SSc. In particular, we
identified a three-gene network comprising *WNT5A*, *RBMS3*, and
*MSI2*, which in combination influenced multiple pulmonary pathology measures. The
associations of these genes with lung outcomes in SSc are novel and high-confidence.
Furthermore, gene coexpression analysis suggested that the interactions we identified are
tissue-specific, thus differentiating SSc-related pathogenic processes in lung from those
in skin.
