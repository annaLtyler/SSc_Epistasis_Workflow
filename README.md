# "Genetic interactions in Systemic Sclerosis"

## Introduction
This workflow accompanies the paper ``Genetic interactions affect lung function in 
patients with systemic sclerosis."

This purpose of this project was to investigate genetic interactions influencing the 
presence of autoantibodies as well as lung function in a cohort of patients with systemic 
sclerosis (SSc). We use the Combines Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis (CAPE) \cite{cape}, 
which increases power to detect interactions by combining information across multiple traits.

We identify three high-confidence candidates that influence lung function in SSc patients.

This workflow is a companion to [cite paper] and performs each step used in the analysis.
