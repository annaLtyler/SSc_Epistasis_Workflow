## "Genetic interactions in Systemic Sclerosis"

This code is a reproducible workflow that accompanies the paper 
"Genetic interactions affect lung function in patients with systemic sclerosis."

This purpose of this project was to investigate genetic interactions influencing the 
presence of autoantibodies as well as lung function in a cohort of patients with systemic 
sclerosis (SSc). We use the Combines Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis (CAPE). 
which increases power to detect interactions by combining information across multiple traits.
This workflow is a companion to [cite paper] and performs each step used in the analysis.
